                    <h2>Welcome to Lotus Occupational Therapy</h2>
                    <p>With over 15 years of experience across various health and education settings, including 12 years as a qualified Occupational Therapist, my career began in a physical re-ablement service for adults. Since then, I have pursued a passion for working within mental health services for both adults and children.</p>
<p>My professional experience spans schools, social care, inpatient, and community services. During my tenure with the NHS, I held roles within different CAMHS teams, providing mental health assessments, staff training, consultation for school staff and other professionals, advice and support for parents and carers, occupational therapy assessments, as well as sensory assessments and recommendations.</p>

                    <h2>About Samantha Hallsworth</h2>
                    <p>In my most recent NHS roles, I worked as an Advanced Occupational Therapist within an Intensive Support Team for children with Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) and in a Sensory Integration service.</p>
<p>As an Independent Occupational Therapist, I specialise in providing assessments and interventions for individuals facing challenges such as mental health issues, neurodevelopmental conditions, sensory processing difficulties, and behaviours that impact daily activities, including self-care, education, and leisure pursuits.
My approach focuses on identifying specific occupational needs and strengths to develop tailored intervention plans that help individuals overcome barriers to participation, enabling them to reach their full potential. I also provide consultation for parents, carers, and professionals seeking advice on these challenges, alongside offering staff training sessions.</p>
<p>I work across Greater Manchester and surrounding areas, delivering services in homes, schools, community settings, or online.</p>
